# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my advent of code 2024 adventure!

I'm not quite sure why you're here, but if you're interested in looking at probably very ugly and bad Rust code, be my guest ðŸ˜Ž

## Running
doing a `cargo run` collects the current day and runs the current day's solution (if it exists). 
### Running a specific day
```shell
cargo run -- DESIRED_DAY
```
I.E
```shell
cargo run -- 1
```
